# WellNest
WellNest will connect people for a better and faster healthcare system, soon we will change the World.

Our project aims to improve the health and communication of our users with doctors and medical services. Users are categorized into patients and doctors. Upon registration, a patient enters their basic information and goals. Based on these, the system creates exercise, diet, and health programs. By selecting a program, the patient can see their daily progress, receive medical support, manage their profile, and receive notifications. The Daily State displays the patient's daily progress according to the specifications of the chosen program and provides additional updates with dietary and exercise suggestions tailored to their needs. The patient's account profile includes their basic information, medical history, and personal doctors. Medical support offers the ability to schedule appointments with doctors of their choice, assistance in finding doctors, pharmacies, and medications suitable for their needs. Additionally, it provides prescription renewal with the doctor's consent, a panic button in case of medical need, and an information system for vaccines and medical tests ideal for the patient. Finally, notifications include updates from the application itself about the patient's account, advice from the doctor, and reminders for appointments and vaccinations.

The doctor has the ability to use the application both as a patient and as a doctor. The doctor's profile includes their basic information, specialty, brief information about themselves, and useful information for their clients. It also provides their availability for appointments, already scheduled appointments, and a list of their current patients. Additionally, the doctor has the ability to provide advice to their registered patients. Notifications include potential appointments, requests for prescription renewals, and new clients.
